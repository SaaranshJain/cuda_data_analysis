Read this book if you love literature.\nI was particularly impressed with  this young author's grasp of the meaning and texture of the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's and '60's...particularly poignant when read in  1999 from another ruined and abandoned French colony, amid the decaying  buildings of Phnom Penh...\nI hope the author will write many more books  and that her publishers will bring her first novel back into print -- I  want to read it.

I had to go back and reread it as soon as I finished it because it is so rich in historical and psychological  details, particularly themes centering on painful family dynamics and history.\n\nPotential readers of this novel by Claire Messud should know it isn't exactly a sunny, bouncy work. If you are looking for that you'll want to look elsewhere. It also moves between countries, including sections based in France, the U.S. and Algeria.\n\nThe focus of the novel is the LaBasse family and the story is told from the viewpoint of Sagesse, a woman who conveys the weight of a turbulent family history. Starting with Sagesse's grandfather, a man who owns the Hotel Bellevue in France,the family dynamics begin to play themselves out, connecting to larger themes of France and Algeria's history as well, with stunning consequences.\n\nSagesse's parents, Alex and Carol, reveal plenty about the kind of problems that can arise when there are cross-cultural challenges to face in a marriage. Carol, coming from America, marries Alex, but is unable to see the potential sacrifices and problems she'll face as she moves overseas to live with her husband...or the impact the marriage will have on her daughter and the rest of the family, including a handicapped son.\n\n It is a bit hard to categorize this book because it covers so many areas. It is part mystery because Sagesse is trying to separate truth from myth when figuring out her family's history. It is part suspense because of Sagesse's short love affair and a moment of violence (and I don't want to give the details of that moment or I'll spoil it for you). It is also a historical novel, rich with information about events in Algeria and France and the United States.\n\nFor me, also, this one centers on themes of personal identity and displacement,primarily for Sagesse, a woman trying to figure out where she belongs in the world and how to make peace with her difficult family as well as coming to grips with history's impact on her family.", "summary": "I'm a huge fan of the author and this one did not disappoint", "unixReviewTime": 1220313600}

I also love the fact that the story is told  through the eyes of fourteen-year-old Lagesse, seen through the eyes of  innocence indeed!

And who's moving - in any sense - in this novel?  Where's the \"bildung?\"  The denouement?  The dsillusionner?  I must have  skimmed the wrong paragraph.\nI do agree that parts of the novel are very  engaging.  They are.  And, like some other readers, I did enjoy the events  in Algeria.  This is the strongest part of the novel, perhaps because it is  not so deeply stuck in the protagonist's life that had the unfortunate  knack of boring me in the first-person!  (Yeah, that's what I mean.)  Overall, the novel is just a bit overdone.  I prefer a bildungsroman - if  that's what this should be - to show me a growth, not tell me all about the  all-too-interesting things that happened along the way.\nIf you're the  kind of person who can sit for hours and listen to a friend tell you  endless stories about herself that you can't help but suspect are just a  tad trumped up, then you might really dig into this novel.

A jeweler has an emerald pendant for sale. Sharples believes this was part of the estate given to Shirley Bruce. Sharples wants Lam to find out how the jeweler got the pendant, and if any pressure was used (Chapter 1). Chapter 2 describes the preliminary investigation. Lam sees Robert Cameron, the other co-trustee show up. Sharples is surprised and astonished to hear this news (Chapter 3). When Lam and Sharples go to visit Cameron, they find a dead body. They call the police from outside the house (Chapter 4). Sharples tells Sgt. Sam Buda that Cameron had no enemies (Chapter 5). The emerald pendant was there. The police investigate the jeweler and the stockbroker who was visited by Robert Cameron earlier that day (Chapter 8).\n\nLam visits Dona Grafton, who minded Cameron's crow when Cameron left the country (Chapter 11). An anonymous donor sent Dona a box of chocolates. Lam inspects the crow's nest. Lam learns that Robert Hockley was getting a passport and decides to follow him (Chapter 12).

All the cliques and having to worry about trying to see if you could become popular makes me shudder to even think about it. That's why I could never even think of applying for a job like Taylor. It's sad to say that I probably wouldn't last very long. What I really liked about Taylor is that even though she works in Hollywood, and has the untimely job of being a second assistant, she's not ditzy. She's really quite smart and knows about the actual movie industry even though she's not too knowledgeable about the hierarchy about moving up.  I really liked learning about scripts and background knowledge myself.  It makes the movie industry become more real when you know this stuff and not just like some magical wonderland.  Taylor is also realistic and relatable. This book does not having annoying slang thrown around by characters and there's not really that much name or label dropping.\n\nIt's funny seeing her battle wits with Kylie with each trying to outdo and slam down the other. Although Quinn appears to be of help to Taylor, it's also a testament to the lack of parenting that goes on in the industry.  I'm really not a fan of how teens can do all these things, ruin people's lives and then get completely away with it. The only qualm is that this is a storyline that has been done numerous times. Almost every chick flick that takes place in a magazine setting has done this plot. Therefore you know exactly what's going to happen. However the story is so engaging and the plot is witty and funny that it really doesn't matter and you get sucked up into the the lives of the characters.\n\nIf you are looking for a great book to bring to the beach this is it. It's a fun read that totally helps you to escape from the normal routines of daily life and brings you to the glamorous world of the rich, famous, and beautiful.

For as long as she can remember, Taylor has loved movies. The reclusive director Michael Deming and his seminal work Journal Girl have been a particular inspiration for Taylor.

But more than the type of work, it's her co-workers that make Taylor miserable. It's like high school all over with the popular girls and their mean tricks. Taylor's too much of a nice girl to acclimatize. Outwitted one too many times by first assistant Kylie and with her job at risk, Taylor asks Quinn, her boss's popular teenage daughter, for tactical advice. It's not about being mean. It's about being confident. Not taking anyone's @#$%...Fake it till you make it...Speak up in class. When you're quiet, you're invisible...Make 1 cool friend...Lunch is a battleground...Enlist a faithful assistant.

Though the plot seems straightforward and predictable, Zoey Dean sets up the conflicts wonderfully. It may be that I'm inured to violence and too sensitive to female bullying, but when I got to where Kylie was setting the first trap for Taylor, I found the tension unbearable. I had to pause, put the book down, and come back to it. After that break from the book, I couldn't put it down. When Taylor seemed naive and too trusting, Dean gave her enough wit to make her likable. As Taylor grew accustomed to manipulation and was veering to the dark side, I still cared about her.\n\nOverall, Hollywood is Like High School With Money is a light, satisfying read. I highly recommend it as a fun escape.\n\nPublisher: Grand Central Publishing (July 23, 2009), 288 pages.\n\nCourtesy of Hatchette Books Group.", "summary": "Fun, satisfying, summer read - would be hilarous movie!", "unixReviewTime": 1248739200}

Freeman", "reviewText": "Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.\n\nNow on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.\n\n Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI's\n\nTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.\n\npros:\nLarge screen\nterrific images\noutstanding volume\n\ncons:\ninability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and vias\na somewhat outdated POI information.\nNon-truck specific routings.\nCost.", "summary": "1st impression", "unixReviewTime": 1283990400}

The audio is loud enough to be heard over road noise and the purr of my Kenworth/Cat engine. I've used it for the last 8,000 miles or so and it has only glitched once. Just restarted it and it picked up on my route right where it should have. The exit lane screen has been spot on every time and gives me plenty of time to get my rig into the appropriate lane safely. I also love the multi-stop route planning and use it a lot. Updated regularly, it has shown me all the construction zones and has a feature to allow me to detour around them. Creating Groups and storing locations in them is a breeze so I can separate warehouse from store locations, etc.\n\nI'm running an HP Pavilion laptop with Windows 7 OS for the dock and update. The USB port DOES charge the GPS, at least with my laptop, despite the warning in a previous review. Even if it didn't, the supplied 12-volt and AC chargers take care of getting the battery up to speed.\n\nMy complaints are relatively minor:\n\nBattery life when it is unplugged isn't great. However, since I use it plugged in in the cab 95% of the time, it doesn't create too much of a problem.\n\nThe announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesn't tell you (or show you on the map display) what state you are in and/or going into. Again, a minor issue because I know where I am but all my other GPS units had this feature. For $500 smackers, I don't expect this kind of slip-up.\n\nThere is a Micro SD slot on the unit and I bought a card for it. Unfortunately, the manual has absolutely no information on using it. The only reference is on the page showing the physical features of the unit, showing the position of the slot.

Has better graphics than Cobra 7\".  It does have lane assist which is important when in large metro areas and need to be in correct lane for exits, etc Atlanta, GA.  I have read some of the negative comments written earlier and I do not have those problems.  Sure, sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past.  I am a car carrier so I set truck size at 13' 8\" and it has kept me from going down roads with 13'6\" bridges.  The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often.  Other than this, I love the fact that:  1) it shows mileage to destination, arrival time (which you can change to time left),  2) shows the city, county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located).  3) large 7\" color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving  4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish Rand McNally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi, maybe when we get at a Loves that use to be a Pilot, just tap on the screen and edit info, then when I connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated.  5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to Rand McNally by the states.  Unfortunately like usual  the states are mostly behind on updates given to Rand McNally.  This is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to Rand McNally.  Many times I have gone into areas that it said \"Construction Ahead\" and no construction is being done because it has been completed.  6)  speed limits of highways and Interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) Still the states have to report these limits to Rand McNally and as usual they are slow on reporting.  But still most of the time 95% it is correct.  7)  great truckers tools like driving hours left.  It automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes.  It lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired. You reset every day manually.  Also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week. You will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn't distinguish off duty and on duty hours well, you have to manually tell it you are on duty.  I just manually configure at the end of the day.  The important one is driving hours and end of the week hours.  8)  service reminders for your perimeters you set, such as 8000 and 16000 services.  You reset manually when completed.  9)  able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route  10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud)  11) ability to save your own poi (I do it all the time)  12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles)  13) it tells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in.  14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day.  saves info for 1 year.

I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6\" bridges when I'm 13'6\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.", "summary": "Great grafics, POOR GPS", "unixReviewTime": 1290556800}

Elephant Run is set during World War II in Burma, which is located in Southern Asia. The main character is 14-year-old Nick Freestone who lived in London, England. After Nick's parents' apartment was destroyed during the German bombing of London, Nick's mother and father both decided it would be safest to send Nick to Burma to stay with his dad on a plantation to get away from the bombing.\n\nAfter a few days in Burma, the Japanese forces attacked their plantation, taking Nick's father as a prisoner of war, leaving Nick to stay with the rest of the Burmese who were given the choir of building an aircraft hanger for the Japanese. Nick finds a way to escape with the help of a Burmese monk of high importance. The monk's niece joined them on their escape. Once they had left the plantation without being spotted, they hitched a ride on a couple of elephants and rode them over to the prison site where Nick's dad was being held.\n\nThanks to the help of a Japanese friend, Nick's dad was able to escape, too. While all four of them were escaping, two guards who were patrolling the prison gates spotted them. The elephant that had assisted Nick on his journey to the prison camp saw that the guards were wearing tiger pelts around their necks. The elephants, thinking that they were a threat because of the tiger pelts draped around their necks, charged the guards and killed them. Nick, his dad, and the monk's niece all were able to find refuge from the war in Australia.\n\nI thought that Elephant Run was a great book.  It was very suspenseful and it held my attention all the way through. I think that anyone would enjoy this book, especially people who are interested in learning about World War II.", "summary": "A great and suspenseful novel", "unixReviewTime": 1381622400}

Secondly, in an ill-conceived effort at humor, the protagonist comes off like a self-righteous jerk--and a sexist one at that.  Third, there were so many spelling and grammatical errors in the kindle edition (\"accept\" instead of \"except\"--twice, by the way...) that I wanted to take a red pen and edit the book myself!
